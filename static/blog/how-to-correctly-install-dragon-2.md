## Save to your boot drive
It's important to install Dragon to your boot drive (also known as the C drive). The installation will default to this location, so simply not changing it is all you need to do. The largest portion of dragon is the user profile. You can move these files to a different location.

## Size matters
Make sure you have enough disk space. It is recommended that you have at least 512GB available size. We recommend using [an SSD](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-an-ssd/) which will allow Windows and Dragon to load faster. You will also need at least 120GB of available disk size in order for Dragon to run properly. Running out of space can cause problems with running applications on Windows, especially Dragon.

## Don't forget about Memory
It's recommended to have a minimum of 8GB of RAM, 16GB is recommended for optimal performance. However, to get the most out of your [installed memory](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2957195/components/how-to-install-new-memory-in-your-pc.html), it's important to have 64-Bit Windows. [Viewing the system information](http://www.simplehow.tips/a/44/how-to-view-system-information-on-windows10) will show what OS version you're currently running.

## Remove previous version before upgrading
If you have a previous version of Dragon installed, it's important to uninstall it before upgrading. Not doing so can cause issues with with the installation process and can corrupt the install. We see this issue pop up a lot when working with our clients and Dragon Professional Individual 15 (DPI 15), and is a common pitfall of the upgrade process.

## Sometimes it's best to start from scratch
If you keep running into issues getting Dragon working, sometimes it's best to simply start over than to spend hours getting it to work. Simply uninstall Dragon, run the Dragon remove utility, reboot the system, and reinstall.
